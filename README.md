# Web Application Projects

This repository contains a collection of web-based applications built using Python libraries. Each project demonstrates practical implementations of data science and machine learning concepts, presented through interactive web applications.

## Projects

1. **AutoML Algorithm App**: An automated machine learning algorithm that helps to build predictive models without manual intervention.
2. **Bio-Informatics App**: A tool for analyzing biological data and making predictions related to genetics and health.
3. **DNA Nucleotide App**: A web app for analyzing DNA sequences and computing nucleotide distributions.
4. **Hepatitis Mortality Predictor**: A predictive model for estimating mortality risk based on hepatitis patient data.
5. **Iris Flower Prediction**: A classification model that predicts iris species based on flower measurements.
6. **Stock Price App**: A web app that predicts stock prices using historical data.
7. **Analyze Classifier Dataset**: A tool for visualizing and analyzing classification datasets.
8. **Diabetes Prediction**: A web app that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user input.
9. **Drug Discovery**: An app that helps predict effective drug candidates based on molecular data.
10. **Forest Fire Prediction**: A model for predicting the likelihood of forest fires based on environmental data.
11. **Stock Price Web App-2**: An enhanced version of the stock price prediction app.
